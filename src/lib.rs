//! # HDL Register Wizard
//!
//! This is a webapp that can generate VHDL code and documentation to create hardware registers accessible on a memory mapped bus. It can load and save files in the Model Description Format developped by Bitvis for its [Register Wizard](https://bitvis.no/dev-tools/register-wizard/). Files saved by this webapp should be usable by Bitvis' tool.
//!
//! ## Project Status
//!
//! The project is under development and is not currently usable. The aim for the first release is to be able to load and save MDF files, as the [Bitvis Register Wizard](https://bitvis.no/dev-tools/register-wizard/) currently lacks a GUI.
//! A future release will also be able to generate code and documentation.
//!
//! The code is currently hosted on [Github](https://github.com/daixiwen/hdl-register-wizard).
//! ## Project License
//!
//! The project uses an MIT license.
