This is the main project page. Give your project a name, and then use the create interface button to create an interface.

You can create several interfaces, for example if you need different protocols or different clock domains. The "New interface" button will take you directly to the interface page.

Use the arrow buttons to change the interfaces order. Click on an interface name or the pen icon to edit the interface, and click on the delete button to remove it.
