# How to build the HDL Register Wizard webapp

> Instructions copied from the seed-rs template

## 1. Install / check required tools

1. Make sure you have basic tools installed:

   - [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) 
     - Check: `$ rustc -V` => `rustc 1.43.1 (8d69840ab 2020-05-04)`
     - Install: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
   - [cargo-make](https://sagiegurari.github.io/cargo-make/)
     - Check: `$ cargo make -V` => `cargo-make 0.30.7`
     - Install: `$ cargo install cargo-make`
       
1. Platform-specific tools like `ssl` and `pkg-config`:
    - Follow recommendations in build errors (during the next chapter).
    - _Note_: Don't hesitate to write notes or a tutorial for your platform and create a PR .

## 2. Project test

1. Open a new terminal tab / window and run: `cargo make serve`
1. Open a second terminal tab and run: `cargo make watch`
1. Open [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in a browser (I recommend Firefox and Chrome).
1. Modify source files (e.g. `/src/lib.rs` or `/index.html`).
1. Watch compilation in the terminal tab where you run `cargo make watch`.
1. You can watch dev-server responses in the tab where you run `cargo make serve`.
1. Refresh your browser and see changes.
1. Go to step 4.

## 3. Unit tests

Open a new terminal tab / window and run: `cargo make test_h firefox`
Replace firefox with chrome or safari depending on the browser you are using

## 4. Prepare your project for deploy

1. Run `cargo make verify` in your terminal to format and lint the code.
1. Run `cargo make build_release`.
1. Upload `index.html` and `pkg` into your server's public folder.
   - Don't forget to upload also configuration files for your hosting, see the [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) one below.

```toml
# netlify.toml

  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```
