Here you can change the interface parameters and the register list.

## Parameters

The interface name will be used in the documentation and the signal names. The interface type will determine which code will be generated and define the interface signals. The description will only be used in the documentation.

When the address width (in bits) is set to automatic, it will be determined from the highest register address. Similarly if the data width is set to automatic it will be determined from the widest register.

## Registers list

Use the "New register" button to create a new register. You will be brought to the register page. "Assign addresses" will give a manual address to every register that is currently assigned to "auto". "Unassign addresses" will set every address back to "auto".

Within the register list, click on the register name or the pen icon to edit the register. The arrow buttons are used to change the order, and the delete button removes it.
