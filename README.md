# HDL Register Wizard

This is both a webapp and a desktop application that can generate VHDL code and documentation to create hardware registers accessible on a memory mapped bus. It can load and save files in the Model Description Format developped by Bitvis for its [Register Wizard](https://bitvis.no/dev-tools/register-wizard/). Files saved by this webapp should be usable by Bitvis' tool.

## Trial

The webapp compiled from the most current sources can be accessed [here](https://daixiwen.github.io/hdl-register-wizard/).

## Project Status

The project is under development and is not currently usable. The aim for the first release is to be able to load and save MDF files, as the [Bitvis Register Wizard](https://bitvis.no/dev-tools/register-wizard/) currently lacks a GUI.
A future release will also be able to generate code and documentation.
